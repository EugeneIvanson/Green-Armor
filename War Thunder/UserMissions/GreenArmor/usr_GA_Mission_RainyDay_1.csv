Another rainy day. Our helicopter was ambushed on the way out, and caught a rocket in the tail. Fortunately, the crew managed to land the helicopter, but it is possible to evacuate them only by land, since they are located directly on the LBS. You have to quickly break through to the landing site of the aircraft, pick up the crew, and deliver the pilots to the hospital. But, since the place is on the front line, enemies are already rushing to it from the other side. We must hurry!"
